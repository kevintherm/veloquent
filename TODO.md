## TODO

- fix: Support strongly typed argument for actions e.g UpdateCOllectionAction fields is accepting array instead of Field vo
- fix: PATCH supposed to modify only the field sent in the payload, while PUT is supposed to replace the entire resource. 
- fix: Sending protected fields even with the same value triggers 422 status e.g Email -> Email change flow
- fix: Viewing relation record produce invalid links because it doesn't account for admin prefix and the route
- feat: Provide handler for common app exception e.g InvalidRuleExpressionException -> 422 or 400

- Battle Testing
